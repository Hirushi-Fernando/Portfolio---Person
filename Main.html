        <h1>A Little About J.K.Rowling</h1>
        <p>Joanne Rowling was born on 31st July 1965 at Yate General Hospital near Bristol, and grew up 
          in Gloucestershire in England and in Chepstow, Gwent, in south-east Wales. Her father, Peter, 
          was an aircraft engineer at the Rolls Royce factory in Bristol and her mother, Anne, was a science 
          technician in the Chemistry department at Wyedean Comprehensive, where Jo herself went to school. 
          Anne was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis when Jo was a teenager and died in 1990, before the Harry 
          Potter books were published. Jo also has a younger sister, Di. The young Jo grew up surrounded by books.
          “I lived for books,’’ she has said. “I was your basic common-or-garden bookworm, complete with freckles and National Health spectacles.”</p>
